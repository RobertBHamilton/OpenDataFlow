When you call open() for a DataProvider 
1. You supply a passphrase in the open() call
2. The DataProvider provides the passphrase to the CredentialProvider
3. The Credential provider decrypts an encrypted string in a properties file and obtains password to the database
4.  Credentials are user/password. They are returned to DataProvider in a java.util.Properties object.
5. The DataProvider then connects to the database using the supplied credentials and provides an opened connection to the caller.

An ironclad rule is that the passprhase used to decrypt is NEVER available to any part of the framework.
To enforce the ironclad rule, no code in core framework ever determines a passphrase.
 
This way if an attacker takes complete control of the framework  database he cannot access any of the registered databases.
Application is responsible for protecting the passphrase and for providing it for the framework to open a connection.
  
The application may pass the passhphrase through command line, through environment, or obtain it from a password vault.
    For now we only support explicit passphrase in function call.
