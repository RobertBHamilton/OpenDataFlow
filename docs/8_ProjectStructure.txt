It is to be written in java with classes which expose methods that will be used in a service pattern.  The "service pattern" means that I provide option to invoke the java classes directly  from command line to provide the needed functionality and command-line classes will be in utility module, but wll will organize them the same way I would a service. 

The services provide specialized interaction with a database component with well defined data model and schema. All database interaction will be strictly ansi sql. 
Except that the initial creation of database, dataflow schema, tables are be platform dependent. The ansi sql will be treated as resources, 
The DDL scripts will be bundled into creation-platform module. Will use factory+strategy pattern to handle different database platforms.
